# Index 
An index of my ideas. 

# Index (long version)
A lot of my thinking happens by writing. I write in these small notebooks. They look like this:


Everytime I fill a notebook up, I copy its table of contents to this index. I often add a little note, or two, for context. But not always. 

This index is ever growing.

If something interests you. [Email me](erik.exists@gmail.com). I would always rather share credit, and get more done.

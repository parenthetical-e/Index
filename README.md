# Index 
Hi. I am Erik, and here is an index of my ideas. 

See, `index.tsv`.


# Index (long version)
A lot of my thinking happens by writing. I write in these small notebooks. They look like this:

Everytime I fill a notebook up, I copy it's table of contents to this index. I often add a little note, or two, for context. But not always. 

This index is ever growing. If something interests you. [Email me](mailto:erik.exists@gmail.com). 

Here's my [CV](https://github.com/parenthetical-e/CV/blob/master/ep-cv.pdf) if you would like to know more about me.

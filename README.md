# Index 
Hi. I am Erik, and here is an index of my ideas. 

See, `ideas.tsv`.


# Index (long version)
A lot of my thinking happens by writing. I write in these small notebooks. They look like this:

Everytime I fill a notebook up, I copy it's table of contents to this index. I often add a little note, or two, for context. But not always. 

I decided, on a lark mostly, to make this list public. Let's see what, if anything, comes of it. If something interests you [email me](mailto:erik.exists@gmail.com).

# Index 
An index of my ideas. See, `index.tsv`.

# Index (long version)
A lot of my thinking happens by writing. I write in these small notebooks. They look like this:

Everytime I fill a notebook up, I copy it's table of contents to this index. I often add a little note, or two, for context. But not always. 

This index is ever growing.

If something interests you. [Email me](mailto:erik.exists@gmail.com). 

I would always rather share credit, and get more done.
